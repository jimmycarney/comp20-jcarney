    <h3>Methodology</h3>
    <h3>Abstract of Findings</h3>
    <h3>Issues Found</h3>
    <div class="issues">
        <h4>Issue #1</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Issue: javascript injection</li>
                <li>Location: javascript injected on /sendLocation page</li>
                <li>Severity: High- anyone can put whatever javascript they want to be executed</li>
                <li>Description: When this command (see below) was executed in the terminal, a data entry containing that javascript was added to the checkins collection. Now, when one tries to access the main app page, they are redirected to the google homepage.</li>
                <img alt="issue #1 description" src="curlinject.png" />
                <li>Proof: This data entry was added to the checkins collection (screenshot from mLab). This results in the redirection to the google homepage.</li>
                <img alt="issue #1 proof" src="injecteddoc.png" />
                <li>Resolution: Add code to remove special characters from the login string so that no one can inject any script tags (see code below)</li>
                <p>login = login.replace(/[^\w\s]/gi, '');</p>
            </ul>
        <h4>Issue #2</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Issue: mongo injection attack</li>
                <li>Location: /checkins.json page</li>
                <li>Severity: High- someone can get all of the data that they should not have access to</li>
                <li>Description: I found the problem by using the following query string:</li>
                <p>https://pure-eyrie-46995.herokuapp.com/checkins.json?login[$ne]=58ijDq5h</p>
                <p>This returns all of the data for the logins that are not the one that is being passed into the query string</p>
                <li>Proof: See photo below</li>
                <img alt="issue #2 proof" src="issue2proof.png" />
                <li>Resolution: Utilize the mongo-sanitize tool to not allow request keys that begin with ‘$’</li>
                <p>var sanitize = require('mongo-sanitize');</p>
                <p>// The sanitize function will strip out any keys that start with '$' in the input,</p>
                <p>// so you can pass it to MongoDB without worrying about malicious users overwriting</p>
                <p>// query selectors.</p>
                <p>var clean = sanitize(req.params.username);</p>
            </ul>
        <h4>Issue #3</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Issue: </li>
                <li>Location: </li>
                <li>Severity: </li>
                <li>Description: </li>
                <li>Proof: </li>
                <li>Resolution: </li>
