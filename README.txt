Lab #8

What is this purpose of this Git repository? (duh!)
This Git repository is now a collection of web development projects
that I can show potential employers or use for reference code in
the future. Also, it made grading easier for Ming.

What was your favorite lab or assignment and why?
My favorite assignment was landmarks because I had experience with
web programming before, but I had never had the chance to use the 
Google Maps API. It was really interesting to see all of the built-in
methods that Google Maps provides and to get the opportunity to
use some of them.

How much do you think you have grown from day 1 of this course to now?
I have experienced a lot of growth as a web developer during this 
semester. I had done some web development before, but it had pretty
much all been front end. The exposure I got to back end development,
during this semester, not only gave me the skills to make much more
advanced web pages, but it also helped me to gain a much greater 
understanding of how websites really function.

What was the most important thing that you learned in this course? Cite two examples as evidence.
One of the most important things that I learned in this course is how
the web actually works. Through the combination of Assignments 2 and 3, I was 
able to see and learn about both sides of web programming. And I was required to 
have a good understanding of HTTP requests and responses in order to complete
those assignments. Part of this understanding how the web works was learning 
basic web security for the first time. Doing Assignment 4 made me realize how 
vulnerable any web page I've ever built is to being taken advantage of. The 
security part of this course helped me to understand how important security is, 
and I now know some practices for creating a more secure web page. 

Now that you have finished the course, what topic would you like to delve deeper into?
I would like to delve even deeper into the topic of security. I was really
interested when we were learning the different types of attacks and ways
to defend against them. I would like to move beyond the basics and learn how
to defend against more advanced attacks so that any web page I build is as 
secure as possible.
