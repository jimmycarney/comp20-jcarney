Lab #8

What is this purpose of this Git repository? (duh!)
This Git repository is now a collection of web development projects
that I can show potential employers or use for reference code in
the future. Also, it made grading easier for Ming.

What was your favorite lab or assignment and why?
My favorite assignment was landmarks because I had experience with
web programming before, but I had never had the chance to use the 
Google Maps API. It was really interesting to see all of the built-in
methods that Google Maps provides and to get the opportunity to
use some of them.

How much do you think you have grown from day 1 of this course to now?
I have experienced a lot of growth as a web developer during this 
semester. I had done some web development before, but it had pretty
much all been front end. The exposure I got to back end development,
during this semester, not only gave me the skills to make much more
advanced web pages, but it also helped me to gain a much greater 
understanding of how websites really function.

What was the most important thing that you learned in this course? Cite two examples as evidence.


Now that you have finished the course, what topic would you like to delve deeper into?
